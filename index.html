        Business Major <br><br>
        Current full-time student at University of California Riverside <br><br>
        Graduated from Hillsdale High School <br><br>
        Current Position: <br><br>
        I am striving toward getting my degree, then studying to obtain my CPA once I finish college. My goals during school are to maintain at least a 3.5 gpa, get an internship during the summer of my junior or senior year, make connections and network with those in the field of business, and to graduate within four years.<br><br>
        Work Experience: <br><br>
        I have worked as a basketball coach during high school, tasked with coaching 1st graders through a 10 week season with games and practice every Sunday. I was required to create a practice plan that would help develop the children's basketball fundamentals, as well as coach them and have them apply what they had learned in practice during a real game. <br><br>
        After I graduated high school, I had the opportunity to help as a staging assistant over the summer. I assisted in staging houses that were put up for sale on the market, so that they looked appealing to prospective buyers.
        About me: <br><br>

        I am from San Mateo, CA, enjoy playing basketball and collecting sneakers, have two siblings along with my parents at home, and my favorite travel destination is Hawaii. Through basketball, I have learned valuable leadership skills that can overlap with my everyday life. I learned how to lead by example, as well as being the one calling the shots. Through my hobby of collecting sneakers, I learned how to look for trends in the market, and what time would be the best to buy and sell the sneakers for the highest profit. I chose the path of business major because of these two hobbies. I became interested in how businesses work and what it takes to run one. Ultimately, it lead to my interest in accounting, since that was one of the classes I was required to take as part of my major.<br><br>

        I am looking for an occupation in the business field, specifically in accounting.
